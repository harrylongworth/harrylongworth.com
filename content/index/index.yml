  Welcome to Harry Longworth's online workspace!   You can find out more about me from my [professional profile on Linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrylongworth).
  
  This site is an ongoing repository for the research and development work I am doing  as one of the co-founders of the [OATSEA Foundation](http://www.oatsea.org) as a working director. 
  
  The main project I'm working on at the moment is [Teacher Virus](http://www.teachervirus.org)  which requires research and development on a very broad range of topics ranging from HTML to childhood learning & education.
  
  I am continually adding content as I make notes and research "stuff" relevant to my projects.  Have a look at my [Glossary](?/glossary) for acronyms and terms relevant to this site (and thus keywords).
  
  The [Blog](?/blog) menu is where I'm providing updates and my [Dev Log](?/dev-log) is where I'm posting progress on my current work/development against my To Do List.
